Example how to read and write text files in Kotlin Native Multiplatform. The generated executable is platform dependent
and can run without a Java Runtime Environment. Thanks [@hankg](https://github.com/HankG) for
the [kotlin-native-file-io-article](https://nequalsonelifestyle.com/2020/11/16/kotlin-native-file-io/).

## ðŸ”¨ Build

**Build all executables and libs**

```shell
gradle build
```

The `build.gradle.kts` automatically detects the current system platform and builds for this. But you can also manually
set one of these targets to cross compile for a different platform:

* `macosX64("native")`
* `linuxX64("native")`
* `mingwX64("native")`

## ðŸš€ Run

**Run the release**

```shell
gradle runReleaseExecutableNative
```

> ðŸ’¡ The main method does expect a file name as parameter.
> It reads that file and prints its content. Without that file name it does nothing.

## âœ… Tests

The `ReadTest` shows how to use it as library dependency.

**Run tests**

```shell
gradle allTests
```
